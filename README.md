The document presents a linear dynamic model for a two-degree-of-freedom rigid robotic arm's visual control. Numerous simulations using Matlab-Simulink explore robot responses to various torque input signals. The findings inform the development of an educational and research-oriented rigid robot. The visual servoing algorithm is then applied to a 6-DOF collaborative robot (Techman TM-700). Initial software simulations in Gazebo-RViz with ROS communication precede real robot implementation.
